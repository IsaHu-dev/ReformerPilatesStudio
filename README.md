### Unfixed Bugs

  Due to an internet connection outage, the intended commit message was not correctly recorded, resulting in multiple commits labeled "Update README.md." At a later stage, to rectify this issue, I will perform a commit history rewrite to remove these commits to maintain a clean commit history.

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub Pages through the Gitpod environment. The deployment process involves the following steps:
